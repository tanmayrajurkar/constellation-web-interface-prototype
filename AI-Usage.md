# AI Usage Disclosure

This project was developed in accordance with the Constellation AI Usage Policy.

AI assistance (ChatGPT) was used in the following limited ways:

## Non-Routine Assistance

- Discussing architectural alternatives for:
  - Finite state machine structure
  - Derived global state design
  - Run timer ownership placement
  - Context separation strategy
- Reviewing structural consistency and identifying unreachable transitions.
- Generating structured walkthrough workflow ideas for demonstration.

All architectural decisions were evaluated, adapted, and implemented manually.  
All code was written, reviewed, and fully understood by the author.

## Routine Assistance

AI was also used for:
- Grammar refinement
- README structuring
- Commit message formatting

## Responsibility Statement

I take full responsibility for all code, design decisions, and implementation details in this repository.  
All components, state logic, and architectural behavior can be explained and justified independently.

No AI-generated code was copied blindly without review or modification.
